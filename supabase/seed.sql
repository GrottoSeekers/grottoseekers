  $bio$We're Callum & Niamh, a couple from the UK who have been house and pet sitting full-time across Australia since December 2025. With years of experience caring for pets and homes back in Britain, we brought that same dedication with us Down Under.

Whether it's a weekend away or a month-long trip, we move in and keep everything running smoothly — daily walks, feeding routines, garden care, and plenty of love for your animals. We treat every sit like it's our own home.

We're returning to the UK in October 2026 and would love to hear from pet owners looking for reliable sitters — whether you're in Australia now or planning ahead in the UK. We're verified on Rover and TrustedHouseSitters, with over 40 five-star reviews.$bio$,
